        <p>
            To log into the system, users will enter their surname and password. Based on the surname provided, the system will automatically determine the user's role as either a part-time lecturer or a full-time administrator. This role assignment will dictate the permissions granted to the user. Part-time lecturers are only able to submit new claims, while full-time administrators have access to view, approve, or deny claims. Lecturers can only view claims that they have personally submitted, ensuring that their data is secure and isolated from others. On the other hand, administrators are responsible for reviewing and processing claims, but they will only be able to approve or deny claims allocated to the lecturer IDs assigned to them, creating a structured system of accountability and reducing the risk of unauthorized claim management.
        </p>

            To maintain security and privacy within the system, all login credentials, such as passwords, are securely stored using encryption to protect against unauthorized access. The system ensures that sensitive data, including personal information and claims, is only accessible by authorized individuals. Administrators have a broader scope of permissions to manage claims, but their access is still restricted to claims linked to their designated lecturer IDs, adding an additional layer of security and privacy. Furthermore, access control policies are implemented to prevent unauthorized users from performing actions beyond their permissions. This strict separation of roles and data access guarantees that both the lecturers’ submissions and the administrators’ decisions are handled with the utmost care, ensuring data privacy and the integrity of the system.
