            Registering with the Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a straightforward process designed to ensure both ease of use and security. Users, which can either be part-time lecturers or full-time admins, need to provide essential information such as their name, surname, email, and password to create an account. Once registered, lecturers can submit their CVs and enter their working details like hours worked and overtime. This streamlined system is highly beneficial as it allows lecturers to easily submit claims for their work and ensures that all records are kept in one place. Full-time admins, on the other hand, use the same registration process but are given different privileges upon logging in, allowing them to view all submitted claims and manage the approval process. The key advantage of this system is its role-based functionality, ensuring that users only see and interact with what is relevant to their role, making it efficient for both claim submission and approval.

            Once a user has logged in, the CMCS system automatically assigns them the appropriate role—either lecturer or admin—based on the combination of their surname and password. This means that a user can either submit claims or approve/deny claims, but never both, ensuring a clear separation of responsibilities. Lecturers will only see the claims they have personally submitted, while admins can access and review all claims submitted by any lecturer. The system employs strong password security protocols, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected. Passwords are hashed before being stored, and the role-based access control further strengthens security by limiting what users can see and do within the system. This structure not only secures the claims and personal information but also ensures that the entire process is transparent and reliable for both lecturers and admins.
